      <h1>Merwin's Shrimp Gumbo</h1>
      <img src="../images/gumbo.jpeg" alt="Delicious Shrimp Gumbo" />
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This is a recipe for a classic, dark brown, shrimp gumbo in true
        Louisiana Cajun country fashion. Serve over rice. Browning the chicken
        pieces in the oil used for the roux adds flavor to the dish. I use the
        cooked chicken for chicken salad. File is added off the heat to thicken
        the gumbo. If added while the gumbo is still cooking, it may become
        stringy and unpleasant. File is ground sassafras leaves. It is available
        in many supermarkets.

      <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1/4 inch rounds</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into parts</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>⅔ cup green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>file powder</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps to Success</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium skillet, brown the sausage over medium heat. Remove from
          pan, and drain on paper towels to remove some of the fat. Discard fat
          in pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over high heat. Brown chicken
          pieces in hot oil. Turn frequently until golden brown on all sides.
          Transfer chicken to a dish, leaving oil in pan. Set chicken aside, but
          keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a roux by whisking flour into the hot vegetable oil. Turn heat
          down to low. Continue cooking flour and oil mixture, stirring
          constantly, until it reaches a dark brown color. This may take 30 to
          45 minutes; the darker the roux, the better the final gumbo.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the roux is a dark brown color, quickly add the sausage, onion,
          green onion tops, green pepper, parsley, and garlic. Cook over low
          heat until the vegetables are wilted, about 10 minutes, stirring
          constantly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in 2 cups water and spices. Add chicken parts. Add rest of the
          water slowly. Bring mixture to a boil, and reduce heat. Simmer for
          about 45 minutes, until chicken is done and tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove chicken pieces, and save for another use. Add shrimp to gumbo;
          cook for about 8 to 10 minutes more. Remove bay leaves. Taste, and
          adjust seasoning. Serve gumbo in deep bowls. Sprinkle file powder over
          individual servings, and stir in.
